3a. Write a shell script to display current working directory, list of all files and display current date and time.

#!/bin/bash

echo "Current Working Directory:"
pwd

echo -e "\nList of all files and directories:"
ls -la

echo -e "\nCurrent Date and Time:"
date



3b. Write a shell script to create a directory, create a file in it and copy the file to another directory.

#!/bin/bash

# Define directory and file names
src_dir="source_dir"
dest_dir="destination_dir"
filename="example.txt"

# Create source directory
mkdir -p "$src_dir"
echo "Created directory: $src_dir"

# Create a file inside the source directory
echo "This is a sample file." > "$src_dir/$filename"
echo "Created file: $src_dir/$filename"

# Create destination directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p "$dest_dir"
echo "Ensured destination directory exists: $dest_dir"

# Copy the file from source to destination directory
cp "$src_dir/$filename" "$dest_dir/"
echo "Copied $filename from $src_dir to $dest_dir"


4a. Write a shell script that accepts two filenames as arguments , checks if permission for thee files are identical or not.

#!/bin/bash

# Check if exactly two arguments are provided
if [ $# -ne 2 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <file1> <file2>"
    exit 1
fi

file1=$1
file2=$2

# Check if both files exist
if [ ! -e "$file1" ]; then
    echo "Error: '$file1' does not exist."
    exit 1
fi

if [ ! -e "$file2" ]; then
    echo "Error: '$file2' does not exist."
    exit 1
fi

# Get permissions of both files in numeric format
perm1=$(stat -c "%a" "$file1")
perm2=$(stat -c "%a" "$file2")

echo "Permissions:"
echo "$file1: $perm1"
echo "$file2: $perm2"

# Compare permissions
if [ "$perm1" = "$perm2" ]; then
    echo "Permissions are IDENTICAL."
else
    echo "Permissions are DIFFERENT."
fi

4c. Shell script to count the number of files and directories in a given path.

#!/bin/bash

# Check if exactly one argument is provided
if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <directory_path>"
    exit 1
fi

path=$1

# Check if the provided path is a directory
if [ ! -d "$path" ]; then
    echo "Error: '$path' is not a valid directory."
    exit 1
fi

# Count files (regular files)
file_count=$(find "$path" -type f | wc -l)

# Count directories
dir_count=$(find "$path" -type d | wc -l)

echo "In directory '$path':"
echo "Number of files: $file_count"
echo "Number of directories: $dir_count"

5a. shell script to accept a name from user and greet them with a message

#!/bin/bash

# Check if a name was provided as a command-line argument
if [ -n "$1" ]; then
    name="$1"
    echo "Hello, $name! (from command-line argument)"
else
    # Ask the user to enter their name
    echo -n "Please enter your name: "
    read name
    echo "Hello, $name! (from user input)"
fi


5b. shell script to add two numbers passed as command line arguments.

#!/bin/bash

# Check if exactly two arguments are provided
if [ $# -ne 2 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <num1> <num2>"
    exit 1
fi

# Read numbers from command-line arguments
num1=$1
num2=$2

# Perform addition using arithmetic expansion
sum=$((num1 + num2))

# Display the result
echo "The sum of $num1 and $num2 is: $sum"






6a. Shell script to check if a number is even or odd.

#!/bin/bash

# Check if exactly one argument is passed
if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <number>"
    exit 1
fi

# Extract the number from command-line argument
num=$1

# Check if input is a valid integer using regex
if ! [[ "$num" =~ ^-?[0-9]+$ ]]; then
    echo "Error: '$num' is not a valid integer."
    exit 1
fi

# Use modulus operator to check even/odd
if [ $((num % 2)) -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "$num is Even."
else
    echo "$num is Odd."
fi


6b. Shell script to check whether a file exists and is readable/writeable/executable.

#!/bin/bash

# Check if a file name was provided
if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <filename>"
    exit 1
fi

file=$1

# Check if the file exists
if [ -e "$file" ]; then
    echo "File '$file' exists."

    # Check readability
    if [ -r "$file" ]; then
        echo "It is readable."
    else
        echo "It is NOT readable."
    fi

    # Check writability
    if [ -w "$file" ]; then
        echo "It is writable."
    else
        echo "It is NOT writable."
    fi

    # Check executability
    if [ -x "$file" ]; then
        echo "It is executable."
    else
        echo "It is NOT executable."
    fi
else
    echo "File '$file' does NOT exist."
    exit 1
fi
